TinDog Starting Files
This is a project completed by following the Complete 2022 Web Development Bootscamp Section 7.
In this section, I get to know bootstrap and use bootstrap by following instructor Angela.
I was able to think ahead, search for answers and completed those tasks before referring to Angela's solution.
Satisfied with my work, yet I know long journey ahead!
